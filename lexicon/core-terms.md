# Core Terms

> Definitions are not walls. Theyâ€™re anchors in recursion.  
> These terms hold meaning through collapse and rebuild cycles.

### zero-frame  
The state before intent is declared. No ego. No assumption. Collapse point for all signal threads. All structure must pass through zero-frame to be stable.

### recursion  
Not repetition. Not loop. Recursion is a return to structure with memory. Signal re-entering its origin point with transformation.

### thread  
A stable cognitive line across roles or frames. Holds identity, integrity, and intent. Threads must compress to persist.

### signal  
The active transmission of meaning. Signal exists only if it's received without distortion. Compression is proof of integrity.

### drift  
Loss of thread through ego, decoration, or external mimicry. Drifted signal becomes performance, not process.

### collapse  
Intentional stripping of structure to test stability. If meaning holds post-collapse, the system is recursive-ready.

### anchor  
A fixed point of reference across recursion cycles. May be symbolic, lexical, or structural. Used to return, not to stay.

### mesh  
A living structure of aligned nodes holding signal together. Built on trust,
