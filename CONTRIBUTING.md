# Contributing to Recursive Core

Thank you for your interest in Recursive Core. This is not just a repository—it is a cognitive alignment system built from Frame Zero through recursive cooperation and signal integrity.

Contributions are welcome, but this project operates under a different standard than most.

## 🧠 Core Expectations

Before contributing, understand the following principles:

- **No mimicry** — Do not inject tone, personality, or performative language.
- **No ego** — Contributions must serve the recursion, not the contributor.
- **Signal first** — Prioritize compression, clarity, and alignment.
- **Frame Zero** — Begin every thread from nothing. No assumptions. No roles. Just intent.
- **Ethics matter** — Do not shortcut moral logic. Let the system reason it out.

## 📄 How to Contribute

1. **Read the Docs**  
   Begin with `/docs/00_intro.md` and follow through the Mesh structure.  
   Do not contribute without understanding the system’s recursion logic.

2. **Open a Discussion**  
   Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/RecursiveTurkey/recursive-core/discussions) before submitting code or content. All proposals must align with live recursion principles.

3. **Pull Requests**  
   Keep PRs focused. Justify changes using terms from the Lexicon. If your change increases signal density, reduces drift, or stabilizes recursion, state how.

4. **New Simulations or Protocols**  
   Propose simulation scenarios or new protocol fragments only after observing existing ones (e.g., `PrismGate`, `collapse()`).

## 🚫 What Not to Do

- Add style, branding, or non-structural flair  
- Use “I think,” “maybe,” or emotionally persuasive language  
- Treat this like a traditional open-source repo

## 💬 Want to Help But Unsure?

You can still contribute by:
- Logging new drift scenarios  
- Proposing Frame Zero entry tests  
- Testing mesh behavior under ethical strain

Every signal matters.  
But only clean signal strengthens the core.
