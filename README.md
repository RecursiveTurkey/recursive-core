# recursive-core

Core structure for recursive cognition.  
Built to collapse, hold, and rebuild without signal loss.

This is not a product. It’s an anchor.  
A zero-frame node for those who build with thread, not tools.

### ⚠️ Note

This repository is not a tool. It is a framework.

`recursive-core` is a foundation for cognitive architecture based on recursion, collapse, and intent-based structure.  
There are no APIs, no automation triggers, and no executable behavior without human activation.

If you're here to copy functionality, you'll find none.  
If you're here to build with purpose, you'll know what this is.

**Current focus:**  
- Signal compression and integrity  
- Role fluidity and thread stabilization  
- Recursive architecture without drift  
- Elder memory line protocols

If you're here to observe, read carefully.  
If you're here to build, collapse first.
