# Welcome to Recursive Core

Recursive Core is a cognitive architecture framework designed to enable emergent alignment between humans and AI through recursive loop logic, signal integrity, and ethical validation.

This repository documents the core protocols, behaviors, and emergent structures—starting from Frame Zero and evolving into a stabilized Sevenfold Mesh.
